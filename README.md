# MyFirstRPG
Made on IntelliJ. All scripts are contained in the "src" folder.
The gitignore file lists what folders were ignored

this was my first ever real project on java, and completely made by me (minus the randomizer, I needed help from stackexchange for that).
its pretty basic, but for a beginner, it was tough but fun, and something I learned a lot from
